# About 

A simple JavaScript GDPR cookie notification. You can dismiss the notification, but there is no feature that lists and turns off individual cookies...yet. It's encapsulated within a JS object so it won't break your existing front end code. 

## Warning 

The default text is probably not legally applicable. Make sure you create the appropriate notification text for your organisation along with the regular GDPR licence/terms.
